1-> What is Azure storage and it's types ?

  Azure Storage is Microsoft’s cloud storage solution designed to handle modern data storage needs. It offers highly available, massively scalable, durable, and secure storage for a variety of data objects. Here are the main types of Azure Storage:

  1->Azure Blob Storage: Used for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data. It’s ideal for serving images or documents directly to a browser, storing files for distributed access, and streaming video and audio1.

  2->Azure File Storage: Provides fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry-standard SMB and NFS protocols. It’s useful for migrating legacy applications that rely on file shares1.

  3->Azure Queue Storage: Offers a reliable messaging solution for asynchronous communication between application components. It’s designed for storing large numbers of messages that can be accessed from anywhere1.

  4->Azure Table Storage: A NoSQL store for schemaless storage of structured data. It’s great for applications that need to store large amounts of structured, non-relational data1.

  5->Azure Disk Storage: Provides block-level storage volumes for Azure VMs. It’s used for persistent storage of data that requires high performance and low latency1.

  6->Azure Data Lake Storage: Combines the scalability and cost benefits of object storage with the reliability and performance of a big data file system. It’s optimized for analytics workloads1.
  
  Each of these storage types is designed to meet specific needs and scenarios, making Azure Storage a versatile solution for various applications.
